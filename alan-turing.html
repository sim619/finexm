		Computers would probably have been non-existent if it wasn't for famous British mathematician, Alan Turing. Having been a child prodigy, he went on to pursue his PhD from the 'Princeton University'. Soon, he became an important member of a group of code-breakers in the 'Government Code and Cypher School' in Bletchley Park. He was given the daunting task of deciphering the ever-changing German codes sent through the ingenious machine, 'Enigma'. Alan proved the almost impossible task, possible with his 'bombe' device, which used a technique called 'Banburismus'. Eventually this mathematician and his team of code-breakers were successful in defeating the 'Enigma'. However, two code-breakers from his team were found out to be Soviet spies, and thus the work was declared highly confidential. For a long time, no records of Turing's work were available, and the 'Official Secrets Act' prohibited him from talking about his work to anyone. His homosexuality caused him to be convicted, though the British government has apologized posthumously in recent times. His works and life has recently been popularized by the ‘Academy Award’ winning movie, ‘The Imitation Game’, released in 2014. Read on and explore the life and works of this brilliant mathematician and code-breaker.

	<ul>

    <li>He designed the programming of the world's first commercial computer - Whilst at the University of Manchester, Alan Turing designed the programming system of the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercially available electronic digital computer.</li>
    <li>He is the father of ArtificiaI Intelligence - Alan Turing is generally regarded as the pioneer of Artificial Intelligence. He believed that computers would be able to learn and devised the Turing Test, which would text whether a computer was really intelligent. No computer has passed the test, as yet.</li>
    <li>Alan was awarded an OBE for his wartime services - He was awarded the OBE in 1945 for services to the country in wartime, despite the fact that most of what he did would not be made public for another 30 years.</li>
    <li>He was the inventor of the Turing Machine - In 1935, Alan Turing invented a device which is now referred to as the Turing Machine. To this day, all stored-programme digital computers are modelled on this invention.</li>
    <li>He was integral to the building of The Bombe. - Although Polish scientists had previously invented a device known as a 'Bomba', Alan took their early versions and developed it into an electro-mechanical machine which greatly helped in the breaking of the Enigma code used by the German forces.</li>
    <li>His work enabled the Enigma to be decoded - By early 1942, the team at Bletchley Park were decoding up to 39,000 Enigma messages a month. Eventually this number rose to 84,000 or about two messages decoded every minute.</li>
    <li>Alan Turing's war work is believed to have shortened the war - Many people, including Winston Churchill, claimed that Alan Turing's work shortened the Second World War by at least two years.</li>
    <li>Alan was a member of the team which decoded the 'Fish' cipher - The 'Fish' cipher which was used towards the end of the war by the German High Command to transmit messages between Hitler and senior officers in the field.</li>
